This is a Power Bi end-to-end project
# Overview
This collection of code and files is all about cleaning up and creating useful visuals for an Amazon sales dataset. We got the data from Kaggle, cleaned it up using Python in Google Colab, and then used Power BI to make detailed visualizations that help us understand the data better.

# Dataset
The Amazon sale report dataset used in this project is used from Kaggle and can be found here. The dataset includes details on e-commerce sales; you can download it directly from the Kaggle platform.

# Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process was performed using Python in Google Colab using pandas and other package. The notebook Amazon.ipynb details the step-by-step process of loading the dataset, handling missing values, and dropping unnecessary columns, converting the datatype . This ensures that the data is in a suitable format and cleaned for visualization.

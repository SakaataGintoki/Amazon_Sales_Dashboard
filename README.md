# Amazon_Sales_Dashboard
This is a Power Bi end-to-end project
# Overview
This collection of code and files is all about cleaning up and creating useful visuals for an Amazon sales dataset. We got the data from Kaggle, cleaned it up using Python in Google Colab, and then used Power BI to make detailed visualizations that help us understand the data better.
